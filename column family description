* HBase can store huge amounts of data in a tabular format for extremely fast reads and writes.It mostly used in a scenario that requires regular, consistent insertion
and overwriting of data.HBase is a type of NoSQL database and is classified as a key-value store.Value is identified with a key.Both key and values are Byte Array,
which means binary formats can be stored easily.Values are stored in key-orders.Values can be quickly accessed by their keysHBase is a database in which tables have no
schema; column families and nocolumns are defined at the time of table creation.HBase is typically used in big data applications where data is constantly changing and 
needs to be processed quickly. It is commonly used for real-time access to data, such as for online transaction processing (OLTP), analytics, and search. HBase is
horizontally scalable, meaning it can easily handle large amounts of data by adding more servers to a cluster.
 
 To create a HBase Database for a Hospital Management System.It include Two Attributes:
      1)Doctor_details
      2)Patient_details
Both include the id and name for the above details.By Using the HBase to insert,delete,update and search the above database.

CREATE TABLE:
To create a table,the following syntax is used:

 create ‘<table name>’,’<column family>’ 
                    
UPDATE TABLE:
To update a data in a table,the following syntax is used:

 put ‘table name’,’row ’,'Column family:column name',’new value’
                     
INSERT TABLE:  
To insert a data in a table,the following syntax is used:

 put ‘<table name>’,’row1’,’<columnfamily:colname>’,’<value>’
                     
DELETE DATA:
To delete a particular data in a table,the following syntax is used: 

 delete ‘<table name>’, ‘<row>’, ‘<column name >’, ‘<time stamp>’

CONCLUSION:
    It can be said that HBase has proved to be a powerful tool over existing Hadoop environments. HBase is a popular NoSQL database with high throughput and low
    latency. HBase garnered developer support from other companies and was adopted by companies for production deployment.
